## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Finally learned how to change de color of a SGV on a hover, by targeting the tag 'path'. Also improved my positioning techniques, merging the diferent displays and positions to get the result expected. And particularly proud of the solution to the section with items texts and paragraphs.

```html
<section class="blocks-section">
      <div class="blocks-header">
        <h2>Supercharge your workflow</h2>
        <p>Weâ€™ve got the tools to boost your productivity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="block-items">
        <div class="block-item">
          <img src="./images/icon-blacklist.svg" alt="list">
          <h3>Create blacklists</h3>
          <p>Ensure sensitive information never makes its way to your clipboard by excluding certain sources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block-item">
          <img src="./images/icon-text.svg" alt="text">
          <h3>Plain text snippets</h3>
          <p>Remove unwanted formatting from copied text for a consistent look.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block-item">
          <img src="./images/icon-preview.svg" alt="">
          <h3>Sneak preview</h3>
          <p>Quick preview of all snippets on your Clipboard for easy access.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
```
```css
svg path:hover {
    stroke: var(--strong-cyan);
    fill: var(--strong-cyan);
    transition: all 500ms ease-in-out;
}
```

### Continued development

Looking foward to improve even more my flex domain, to build a responsive layout, and also position better my elements, without using margin that much.
